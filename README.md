## Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services with a company. Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses, especially in industries like telecommunications, where retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers at risk of churning. By leveraging historical customer data, the model aims to recognize patterns and factors associated with churn. This information is valuable for the telecom company as it enables proactive retention strategies, such as targeted promotions or personalized offers, to retain customers and reduce overall churn rates.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI:** A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Scikit-Learn:** A machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Used to create a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the predictive model.

## How to Use

To interact with the model, users can access the web interface provided by FastAPI. The interface prompts users to input relevant customer information, and upon submission, the model predicts the likelihood of churn. The prediction is then displayed on the interface along with personalized messages based on the customer's name.

## Data Preprocessing

The input features for the model include various customer attributes such as gender, tenure, internet service type, contract details, and more. The data is preprocessed to handle categorical variables, create new features, and ensure compatibility with the machine learning model.

## Model Development

The model used for prediction is trained on historical customer data with known churn outcomes. It employs a machine learning algorithm to learn patterns and relationships within the data. The trained ## Contact

model is then used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Enhancements and Future Work

This project can be extended by incorporating additional features, optimizing model hyperparameters, and exploring more advanced machine learning techniques. Continuous monitoring and updates to the model can ensure its effectiveness in predicting customer churn in a dynamic business environment.
